maya plug ins 

These are a collection of common use maya plugin scripts I've collected from other online sources or my own work for generating maya deformers or inverted blendShapes, etc for quick rigging and common shot deformation work. The .mll are compiled for maya 2014. I have some other user's code with links or authors included here for students in rigging classes to have a common access point herein.
